# MULTIPLATFORM ALIASES AND SHIMS

# NOTE: This multiplatform aliases are intended to help in
#       the process of migrating code from other languages.
#       Besides being harmless in nature (some aliases are
#       not even value equivalent, but will let your code
#       be easily adapted), are not meant to be used in a
#       regular basis. Be wise and translate all the code
#       you are testing for migration asap.
